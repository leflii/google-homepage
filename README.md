# google-homepage

This current project is the deconstruction of an existing web page and t
he rebuilding of it. I hope to demonstrate the ways of moving a div around the p
age, sticking a div onto the bottom of the page, identify the background color o
f an existing webpage, grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage, cente
r an element horizontally, identify ways to include CSS style in a page, underst
and how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page, b
uild a very basic form
